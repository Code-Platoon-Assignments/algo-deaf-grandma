## Considerations (Javascript)

To run the program: `node.js deaf_grandma.js`

* In your code you'll definitely need to use `if` and likely an `else if` and `else`.
* We have provided some "guide code" showing you how to prompt for user input from the command line and do something with it, which is not straightforward with node.js
* The `package.json` file is there to tell node.js to use ES6 modules for importing/exporting functions, etc. We will learn more about this later.
