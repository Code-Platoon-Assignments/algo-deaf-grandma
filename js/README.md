## Considerations (Javascript)
* In your code you'll definitely need to use `if` and likely an `else if` and `else`.
* This will be hard to do in the terminal with Node.js, because Node.js doesn't have a great built-in prompt.
* This is relatively easy to do in the browser with `window.prompt`, but you'll need to use an HTML file to run your javascript file.
