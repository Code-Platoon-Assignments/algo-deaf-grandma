## Considerations (Python)
* In your code you'll definitely need to use `if` and likely an `elif` and `else`.
* Also remember that `input()` is the "inverse" method of `print()` -- while `print()` outputs information to the terminal, `input('command Prompt')` captures information from the user by presenting a command prompt and allowing them to type input.
* If you have an infinite loop, how might you break out of it?
